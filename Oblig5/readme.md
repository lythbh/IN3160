# Functions, packages and a self-checking testbench
IN3160/4160
Version 2025-1

In this exercise, you will explore VHDL functions and create a VHDL package. You will also build a self-checking testbench with Cocotb. 

Optionally, you will highlight some architecture features in FPGA design. 

## a)	Simulate 
* Simulate the attached code in pargen.vhd and tb_pargen.py (the given Makefile may be used).
  
Here two 16-bit vectors (`indata1` and  `indata2`) are read in and a parity signal `par` is generated. 

* Create a PNG-image of the simulation result.
  (_gtkwave: File->Grab to file_)

> **Optional** 
> * Create a project using the pargen.vhd file before modifications) in Vivado. (Remember to select VHDL 2008 for both sources).
> * Open the RTL-analysis->Elaborated Design, and look at the schematic generated. 
    Zoom in and compare the paths of the parity_toggle and the XOR_Parity (RTL_REDUCTION_XOR).
> * How many ports are required for each path? 
    (Not counting inverters, only (N)AND/ (N)OR/ X(N)OR).
> *  If we would implement this schematic in a full custom ASIC, which version would be favorable? 
     (consider how many gate delays they will induce)
> *   Synthesize the design and open the synthesized design schematic.
>      Note that the differences you will see compared to the RTL schematic are mostly due to the FPGA architecture consisting of logical blocks having mostly look-up tables (LUTs) and flip-flops.
> * Does it seem to make any difference whether our code indicates the use of multiplexers or reduction XOR if we implement it on a Xilinx Zynq-series FPGA?


## b) Modify the parity generator
* Modify the code in pargen.vhd to encapsulate the two different methods in separate functions for creating parity calculation.

## c)	Create a package 
* Move the functions in b) to a `subprog_pck` package. Modify **pargen.vhd** from part b of the exercise to use the functions from the `subprog_pck` package.
  
## d)	Complete the stimuli generator 
* Modify the given **tb_pargen.py** and complete the function `stimuli_generator()` so that it generates randomized stimuli for `indata1` while `indata2` is counted up.
At least 20 random values should be applied. 

## e)	Complete the compare function
* Modify the given **tb_pargen.py** and complete the function `compare(dut)` so that the output `par` and the internal signals `xor_parity` and `toggle_parity` are checked each clock cycle. 
  Use assertions on the monitored signals.
  (If you have made changes to their names, check the new corresponding signals). 
  _You may use the provided functions parity(value) and predict(dut) to calculate the expected values._

During simulation, values should be checked after all delta-delays caused by the trigger have been simulated. 
In cocotb, this can typically be achieved using `await ReadOnly()` after awaiting the clock edge. 

> [!TIP]
> The ouptput `par` only updates on rising_edge(mclk).
>
> The check itself may run indefinitely, as long as it is disjoint from stimuli generation.
>
> Going from `integer` to `std_logic_vector` requires deciding on whether you will use `signed` data or not.
> Here is an example on how to convert from `integer` to an arbitrary length `std_logic_vector` using `numeric_std` and `std_logic_1164` libraries:
 ```vhdl
 my_var := std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(i, my_var’length));
 ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Approval:
> * Simulation result (png)  for a) and e)
> * VHDL source file for the individual questions.
> * Modified tb_pargen.py
> * Optional: Answers to optional questions (below).
> **This assignment may be approved in lab.**
>   
>   When approved in lab, comments and feedback are given orally, and there is no need for uploading content.
>   The lab supervisor will mark the assignment as demonstrated in lab in the learning platform (Canvas).
